    "\n",
    "Grouping (aka selecting) is a very common task.   Say, you had 10 participatns and each completed 3 conditions.  By \"grouping\" we mean taking considering each \"group\" of 10 participants seperately for each condition and calculating something, like an average.   That's just one example.  There are many others that can be done.    It's one of the most useful tools to be able to do easily on a dataset.  \n",

    "Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.  They define both the data and useful things to do to the data.  Because they are together you can unlock some simple syntax that can do complicated things.\n",
